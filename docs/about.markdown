Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm currently working on my Master's in Computational Biology & Bioinformatics at the Universit√§t Bern in Switzerland. I previously spent some time at [Hexagon Bio](https://www.hexagonbio.com/) doing high-throughput drug discovery, and at [3Bar Biologics](https://www.3barbiologics.com/) working on biostimulants. I have been for many years writing down snippets of ideas about science, metascience, bibliometrics, methodology, nonsense, etc., and I'd like to start expounding on them here. You can find me at:
